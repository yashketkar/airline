## Case study

### General guidelines and information
This is a business case - where your skills to evaluate a business problem will be evaluated.
However,we belive in utilizing new technology to solve old problems, your creativity and usage of tools will be given high weightage.

### Part A
Airline A is currently flying a large international network. Their flight operations are shown in the tab "Operations". Various aircraft characteristics are listed in tab "AC characteristics". They would like to know the following:

#### 1) What is the total cost by aircraft type for the year? (Suggested tools: Any of R/Python/Access/SQL) (25 points)
Note: Total cost = Hours flown * Costs/hour

#### 2) Which aircraft type  has the lowest cost per seat per km flown? (25 points)

### Part B
Airline B is a startup airline and is considering flying on the city pairs as shown in tab "City Pairs". They would like to know:

#### 1) Which aircraft types are best suited for their operation?  (Suggested tools: Any of R/Python/Access/SQL) (35 points)

Note:

- This is an optimization between 3 factors: Range, Passenger demand, costs.
- Hence the aircraft which is capable of flying between 2 cities (range), has enough seats to meet the demand, and has the lowest cost will win.
- Please also note that the passenger demand is per day, hence an aircraft can make several trips between 2 cities to meet that demand.
- 1 aircraft type will always be most suitable for a given city pair. Hence resultant fleet would be a mix of different aircraft types.
- In case you are unable to get to the final solution, please lay out the step-by-step approach to be used.

#### 2) Please prepare a short report with your recommendations on Part A and Part B. Report can be in any format (though interactive mediums are always preferred). (15 points)
